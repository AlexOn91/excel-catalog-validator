# Excel Catalog Validator

A complete desktop application for validating Excel product catalogs, built in **Python** with **Tkinter**, **Pandas**, and **OpenPyXL**.  
The app allows users to upload Excel files, run multiple data integrity checks, and generate structured error reports.
---

## ‚ú® Features
- **User Interface (Tkinter)** for file selection and sheet mapping.
- **Validation checks**:
  - Mandatory field completeness.
  - Uniqueness on key columns (e.g., ProductID, SKU).
  - Detection of hidden rows and columns.
  - Invalid characters, Excel formulas, HTML tags.
  - URL format validation (text and hyperlinks).
- **Error Reporting**:
  - Export structured fail reports into a separate Excel file.
  - Errors grouped by validation rule.
  - Includes cell references for easier review.
- **Performance**: tested with catalogs up to **65,000+ rows**.
- **Packaged executable**: built with **PyInstaller** (Windows `.exe`).

## üì∏ Screenshots

Below is a full demo flow of the Excel Catalog Validator:

1. **Example input Excel file (demo)**  
   The validator works with product catalogs in Excel format.  
   This sample file includes intentional errors: duplicate SKUs, hidden rows, and multiple identifiers in one cell.

2. **Load file and select sheet**  
   Users can load an Excel file and choose the worksheet to validate.  
   ![Load File](docs/screenshots/load_file.png)

3. **Map & rename columns**  
   Flexible mapping between the catalog fields and required properties.

4. **Validation results (part 1)**  
   High-level checks for file format, hidden rows/columns, mandatory field completeness, and invalid characters.  
   ![Validation Results 1](docs/screenshots/results_part1.png)

5. **Validation results (part 2)**  
   Advanced checks for uniqueness, URLs, character limits, and per-cell constraints.  
   ![Validation Results 2](docs/screenshots/results_part2.png)

6. **Exported fail report (Excel)**  
   A structured fail report is generated, grouping all detected errors.  
   Each error includes explanations and **cell references** for quick navigation.  
   Example: HTML tag found in a product name.

üì¶ Executable (for HR / non-technical users)

The project also includes a packaged Windows executable (.exe) built with PyInstaller.
‚ö†Ô∏è The .exe file is not uploaded here because GitHub does not allow files larger than 50 MB.

üëâ If you want to test the app directly without installing Python, I can provide the .exe version on request.
